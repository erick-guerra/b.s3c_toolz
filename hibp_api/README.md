# hibp_api (Have I been Powned)

In attempts to tighten up my 'digital foot-print', I though I should start with what information already out there,
in particular where my compromised points of security, due to data breaches, might lay. So did a a little script to
make request to hibp's website using their browser, rather then api handler endpoints.  I feel I get more data this way.
